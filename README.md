# Meet Hairison Bader

A stupid little thing I made as a Mother's Day gift for a particular special Cards fan

~I suppose I'll keep this up until Bader cuts his hair short (if he ever does!)~

Oh, how the mighty have fallen. I've changed my mind - I'll keep this public as a memorial to his once-luscious locks
